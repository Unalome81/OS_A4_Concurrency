Readme Starts here
This readme file Belongs to OS-assignment 4 Q3 written by Vivaswan Nawani and Animesh Pareek.

1) How to run->

=> To compile : make compile
=> To clean : make clean
=> To run: make run
=> To do everything : make

2) File Details->

=> We are using only one file, "Bridge.c" in this section.

3) File Description ->

=> We are using using a Bridge thread to simulate the bridge, left threads for left side cars and right thread for right side cars.

=> void* left(void* args) is the routine for the left car thread.

=> void* right(void* args) is the routine function for the right car thread.

=> void* bridge(void *args) is the routine for the Bridge thread.

=> We are maximizing the use of the bridge and the efficiency of the logic by ensuring that the maximum number of cars that can 
travel in the road at a given time (5 in this case), do travel if possible with the help of counting sempahores.

4) How do we avoid concurrency bugs?

=> We avoid concurrency bugs by writing the critical condition code inside a binary semaphore, thus seperating *left and *right execution
and keeping them independent and ensuring that one occurs only after the other is finished and not simultaneiosuly.
